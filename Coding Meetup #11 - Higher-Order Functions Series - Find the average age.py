'''You will be given a sequence of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

Given the following input array:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Maria', lastName: 'Y.', country: 'Cyprus', continent: 'Europe', age: 30, language: 'Java' },
  { firstName: 'Victoria', lastName: 'T.', country: 'Puerto Rico', continent: 'Americas', age: 70, language: 'Python' },
];
write a function that returns the average age of developers (rounded to the nearest integer). In the example above your function should return 50 (number).

Notes:

The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
Age is represented by a number which can be any positive integer.'''


def get_average(lst): 
    # your code here
    list=[i['age'] for i in lst]
    sum=0
    for i in list:
        sum+=i
    return round(sum/len(list))
